Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

The 3 project gutenberg stories are as follows:

peter_pan.html (from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm)

jungle_book.html (from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/236/236-h/236-h.htm)

wizard_of_oz.html (from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/55/55-h/55-h.htm)

all of which use the css file gutenberg.css (mostly copied from the original gutenburg html files)


My good personal page is: dylan_good.html

My bad personal page is: dylan_bad.html

They use good.css and bad.css respectively

The bad version uses a dancing hamster gif from http://pethamstercare.com/hamster-gifs/dancing-hamsters-4/
