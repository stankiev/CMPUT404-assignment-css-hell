Hello, my name is Dylan. I&#39m currently a fifth year undergraduate student at the University of Alberta taking Honours in Computing Science. I have an extensive background of experience working on both class and personal projects, and I've completed a 16 month internship. In my free time I enjoy playing dodgeball, badminton, ping pong, and competitive Super Smash Bros.
</p>
<p>
My 16 month internship from May 2013 to August 2014 was for the <a href="http://irc.construction.ualberta.ca">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at the University of Alberta. During this internship I gained immense experience developing desktop applications in C#, as well as some exposure to Python, Java, and Visual Basic. I helped maintain a discrete event application called Simphony which is primarily used by civil engineering graduate students for their theses.
</p>
<p>
I&#39m currently the President of the East Campus Students&#39 Association which has given me various experiences. Our four Executive members are responsible for advocating for over 300 residents. We help manage a budget, host events, provide services and a sense of community to residents. During my term I've helped to completely redevelop the <a href="">ECSA website</a> to allow for more functionality and organization. I've also developed a simple C# program to allow for easier maintaining of the website for future Executives.
